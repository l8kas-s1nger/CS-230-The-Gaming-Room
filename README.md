The Gaming Room was the client in which I aided them as a Technology Consultant working for Creative Technology Solutions. The Gaming Room wanted a web-based game which works with their existing app called Draw It or Lose It. The requirements were that the web-app supported real-time multiplayer, cross-platform compatibility, and secure cloud hosting.

I think I did well at clearly laying out the requirements and foundations for their project so the client’s needs were easy to follow. I also touched up on their code and added the iterator and singleton patterns.

Working through the design document helped me to realize the requirements of the application and to create a more complete product when I edited the code. 

If I could revise one part, I would expand the design constraints section with more potential constraints, to make the limitations and problems more clear. 

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the requirements and working around the constraints. This includes considerations like future scalability and cross-platform support. This is important as the software has to match what people expect and use.

I approached designing the software by organizing it around requirements and patterns. In the future I’d continue using step-by-step planning to guide the design process.
